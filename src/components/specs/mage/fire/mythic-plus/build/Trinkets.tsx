        For Mythic+ there are several viable options for trinkets. Here's the
        better ones :

              <ItemLink
                className="font-semibold"
                item={items['alacritousAlchemistStone']}
              />{' '}
              - Very strong Intell proc with a good uptime (arround 38% for me)
              and a ton of free haste which is by far our best secondary stat.
              <br />
              This trinket is much stronger on Firestorm as it usually procs on
              pull (so you benefit from it during burst which increases its
              value).
              <br />
              It also lowers your prepot cooldown everytime which is a good
              extra bonus.

              />{' '}
              - This is in my opinion our bis fire mage trinket by far if you
              can get yourself a decent amount of gems. If you can get full gems
              this trinket has insane value. <br />
              On top of this, it's use on Firestorm is even stronger as it
              always procs when you pull.
              <br />
              When you pull you will get X amount of stacks (each stack
              rewarding an amount of haste, and X is your number of socketed
              Ysemerald gems. In my case I proc 8 stacks everytime as I'm fully
              socketed). So as soon as I pull, I will go from 0 to 8 stacks,
              this lasts until I reach 18 stacks. It won't fall off until you
              reach 18 stacks, which means that if you have 8 stacks and stop
              fighting for as long as you want, you will keep this buff.
              <br />
              This can be used to proc it first on a creature to reach 8 stacks,
              so on your next pull you will start pulling going from 8 to 16
              stacks, which will provide a lot of haste for your burst.

              />{' '}
              - Good versa/haste procs if your healer and tank also have it.
              It's imo weaker than the two previous options if you manage to get
              full gear and good stats (and gems).

              nicely with our bursts.
