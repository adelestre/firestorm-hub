        is usually the best option. Lariat is a very strong stat proc that you
        can control with your socketed gems. As we usually want haste procs, you
        will have to equip only air gems, head to the gems section for more

        gems because its uptime decreases a lot for every missing gem. You
        should also not equip different types of gems as even 1 gem of a
        different will make you lose 50% of your haste procs.
