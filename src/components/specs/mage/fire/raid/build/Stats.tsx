                It also lowers your GCD which allows you to weave in more spells

                <br />
                It also reduces the travel time of some spells (ex{' '}

      <Paragraph>
        As a fire mage we will look mainly for damage output aswell as damage
        reduction.
      </Paragraph>
      <List className="list-decimal">
        <ListElement>
          <span>Intellect</span>
        </ListElement>
        <ListElement>
          <span>Haste</span>

          <span>Mastery</span>
        </ListElement>
        <ListElement>
          <span>Critical Strike</span>
        </ListElement>
      </List>
      <Paragraph>
        Our stats are pretty straight forward, we go for as much ilvl as we can
        as intellect is our best stat, but Haste also has insane value.
        <br />
        Versa also scales very well for Fire mage in our current patch (10.1.5),
        this is very good as Versa makes us tankier which is pretty good.
        <br />
        In some scenarios it's actually better to prioritize a gear with high
        haste on it (especially if it also has Versa) rather than having a small
        increase in ilvl/intellect.
        <br />
        It could for exemple be much better to go for a Haste/Vers Chest 415
        rather than a Mastery/Vers gear 418.
        <br />
        <br />
        To give you a rough idea on our stats worth, my personnal stat weights
        as Fire is 8.81 Int, 4.50 Haste, 3.56 Vers, 3.02 Mastery, 2.74 Crit.
        Every char will sim different but it still gives you a rough idea.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        It is worth mentioning that Critical Strikes gets even weaker value as
        you get more haste and play better. Also the more target there is, the
        least value it has. This is mostly due to some talents (ex{' '}
        <ItemLink item={spells['fm-phoenix_reborn']} />, as on big AOE you get a
        ton of ignites and a ton of resets, you get a lot of{' '}
        <ItemLink item={spells['fm-pf']} /> refunds. Same goes for{' '}
        <ItemLink item={spells['fm-fireblast']} /> with{' '}
        <ItemLink item={spells['fm-fervent_flickering']} />
        ).
