        For the entierity of the damage section of this guide, you are
        considered at all time to be on your{' '}
        <ItemLink item={spells['mw-faeline']} />. It is tremendously ineficient
        not to have the buff while using damaging spells. The way it works is
        that everytime you step on it, you get an 8 sec aura that will buff your
        damaging spells. You don't need to stay on it at all cost, but you need
        to refresh it at least every 8 sec. Understand that if the mobs are too
        far from it, it will be very difficult for you to deal damage and heal.
        So be aware of any incoming movement from your tank. The only tip I have
        is using Chi Burst while on it since it is a very good spell to refresh
        the CD (each ally and each enemy counts as 1 spell casted).
